[SWC 2009.02.18]
* Added in unary plus to allow expressions like "+1000".

[SWC 2008.02.07]
* Promoted strategy applicability condition, given special syntactic treatment to distinguish semantics from branch conditions.
* Removed "root node" term as a consequence of the above.
* Removed parametrization for strategy.
* Added distinction between VAR_LIST vs. FUNC_LIST for declarations.
* Renamed fail block (and FAIL) to error block, and changed visitor and corresponding Stitch classes accordingly.
* Added FAILURE condition to strategy.

[SWC 2008.02.06]
* Added function "define" capability to script level.

[SWC 2008.02.05]
* Added "define" keyword for strategy function; updated Stitch editor to reflect keyword.
* Eliminated extraneous "| done" after null-tactic; makes "done" meaning consistent to be "successful completion".
* Moved timer from condition clause to action as explicit control of settling time, modifying TimedCondition to support list of expressions.
* Removed exit condition from language feature due to potential breach of tactic atomicity.
* Gave explicit treatment to strategy root node as applicability condition.
* Added Model Repository interface to allow Tactic to freeze and unfreeze model.
* Modified Tactic evaluation to invoke model interface that freezes and unfreezes model.
* Reference lookup in Stitch script is modified to account for frozen model.
