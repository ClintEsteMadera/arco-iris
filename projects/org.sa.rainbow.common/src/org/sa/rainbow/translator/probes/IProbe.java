/**
 * Interface for a standard Probe, encoding its lifecycle states.
 * Valid probe transitions are:<ol>
 * <li> Create: NULL -> INACTIVE
 * <li> Destroy: INACTIVE -> NULL
 * <li> Activate: INACTIVE -> ACTIVE
 * <li> Deactivate: ACTIVE -> INACTIVE
 * </ol>
 * Any other transitions should trigger a BadLifecycleStepException.
 * <p>
 * A Probe has a unique ID, set at instantiation time in the form of
 * "{name}@{location}".  The {name} should be unique within the {location} in
 * which the Probe is deployed.  The {location} is usually the hostname where
 * the Probe is deployed.  If location is unknown, its value should be set to
 * <code>NULL_LOCATION</code>.
 * <p>
 * Identifiable.id() should return the unique ID of this Probe, as "name@location".
